This project is only capable for Data Transformation and Model Learning. Integration with the front end is part of another project.

## Short Description

This project involves using Python and Jupyter Notebook to transform raw data into a format suitable for machine learning and train a predictive model using the transformed data.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Python 3.7 or later on your machine if it is not already installed.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook using the following command: `pip install jupyter`.
3. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
5. Create a new virtual environment for the project using the following command: `python -m venv venv`.
6. Activate the virtual environment using the following command:
   - For Mac or Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
7. Install the required Python packages using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
8. Launch Jupyter Notebook using the following command: `jupyter notebook`.
9. Open the project's main Jupyter Notebook file and follow the instructions to transform the data and train the model.

That's it! You should now be able to set up the project and start working with the data and model learning notebooks. Happy coding!
